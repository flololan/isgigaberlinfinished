# Accessibility

## What is digital accessibility?
An accessible website is a website that allows people with disabilities to access its content and functionality without difficulty.

An accessible website allows for example to :

- navigate with a voice synthesis and/or a Braille display (used in particular by blind and visually impaired people);
- customize the display of the site according to one's needs (enlarging the characters, changing the colors, etc.);
- navigate without using the mouse (with the keyboard only, via a touch screen, by voice or any other adapted device).

To do this, the site must comply with the standards in force at the time of its creation and its updates.

## Declaration of conformity to the GGAA

This site is not officially compliant but tries to be as much as possible within the framework of a study project.
