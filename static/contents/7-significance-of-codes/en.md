# Significances of codes

## Definition

The criterion signi® cance of codes qua- li® es the relationship between a term and / or a sign and its reference. Codes and names are signi® cant to the users when there is a strong semantic relationship between such codes and the items or actions they refer to.

## Rationale(s)

When codes are meaningful, they are more easily recalled and identi® ed. In addition, non signi® cant codes or nam es may lead to inappropriate operations on the part of users, and thus to errors.

## Examples of guidelines

* Titles should be distinct and meaningful.
* Make abbreviation rules explicit.
* Codes should be meaningful and familiar rather than arbitrary (e.g., M for Male, and F for Female rather than 1 and 2).
