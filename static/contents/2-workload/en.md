# Workload

## Definition

The criterion *workload* concerns all interface elements that play a role in reducing the usersâ€™
perceptual or cognitive load, and in increasing the dialogue eciency.  The criterion *workload* is subdivided into two criteria:  
*Brevity* (which includes *conciseness* and *minimal actions*), and *information density*.

## Rationale(s)

The higher the workload, the higher the probability of making errors. Also the less users are distracted by unnecessary information, the more they will be able to accomplish their task efficiently. Besides, the shorter the required actions, the faster the interac- tions.
