# Consiseness

## Definition

The criterion *conciseness* concerns percep- tual and cognitive workload for individual inputs or outputs.  By denition, conciseness does not concern feedback or error messages.

## Rationale(s)

Short term memory capacity is limited. Consequently, the shorter the entries, the smaller the probability of making errors. Besides, the more succinct the items, the shorter the reading times.

## Examples of guidelines
* For numerical data, entry of leading zeros should not be necessary.
* If codes are longer than 4 or 5 characters, use mnemonics or abbreviations.
* Allow users short data entries.
* When a measurement unit is associated with a particular data field, include that unit as part of the eld label rather than requiring a user to enter it.
