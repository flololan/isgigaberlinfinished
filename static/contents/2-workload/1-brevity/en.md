# Brevity

## Definition

The criterion *brevity* concerns the percep- tual and cognitive workload both for individual inputs and outputs, and for sets of inputs (i.e., sets of actions needed to accomplish a goal or a task).. *Brevity* corresponds to the goal of limiting the reading and input workload and the number of action steps.  The criterion brevity is subdivided into two criteria:
*Conciseness* and *minimal actions*.

## Rationale(s)

Short term memory capacity is limited. Consequently, the shorter the entries, the smaller the probability of making errors. Besides, the more succinct the items, the shorter the reading times.  Also, the more numerous and complex the actions necessary to reach a goal, the more the workload will increase and consequently the greater the risk of making errors.
