# Information density

## Definition

The criterion *information density* concerns the users’ workload from a perceptual and cognitive point of view with regard to the whole set of information presented to the users rather than each individual element or item.

## Rationale(s)

In most tasks, users’ performances become worse when information density is too high or too low: in these cases, errors become more likely. Items that are not related to the task should be removed.  
Memory load on the user should be minimized. Users should not have to memorize long data lists or complicated procedures. They should not have to undertake complex cognitive activities when these are not required by the task at hand.

## Examples of guidelines
* Provide only necessary and immediately usable data for any transaction; do not overload displays with extraneous data.
* Data should not require unit translations. 
* Query language should use the minimum of quantifiers in query formulation.
* Do not require users to remember data accurately from one display frame to another. 
* Provide automatic computation of derived data, so that a user does not have to calculate and enter any number that can be derived from data already accessible to the computer.
