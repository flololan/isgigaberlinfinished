# Flexibility

## Definition

The criterion ¯ exibility refers to the means available to the users to customize the interface in order to take into account their working strategies and / or their habits, and the task requirements. Flexibility is re¯ ected in the number of possible ways of achieving a given goal. In other words, it is the capacity of the interface to adapt to the users’ particular needs.

## Rationale(s)

The more diverse the means available to perform a given task, the greater the likelihood that users will choose and master one of them during learning.

## Example of guidelines
* When user requirements are uncertain, provide users with some means to control display con® g- uration.
* When interface designers cannot predict which default values will be helpful, permit users to de® ne, change or remove default values for data entry.
* When some displays are unnecessary, the users should be able to remove them temporarily.
* Provide some means for users to change the data entry sequence to respect their preferred sequence.
* When text formats cannot be predicted in advance, allow users to specify and store the formats that might be needed.
* Users should be able to assign names to data ® elds they have created.
