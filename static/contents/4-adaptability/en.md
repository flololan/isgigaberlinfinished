# Adaptability

## Definition

The *adaptability* of a system refers to its capacity to behave contextually and according to the users’ needs and preferences.  The criterion adaptability is subdivided into two criteria: *Flexibility* and *user experience*.

## Rationale(s)

The more diverse the ways of achieving a given task, the more likely a particular user will ® nd a way that suits him / her, a way that he / she will master in the course of learning. It follows that diŒerent proce- dures, options, and commands must be available to the users for them to achieve a given goal. In addition, a given interface cannot be suitable for all of its potential users. To avoid negative eŒects on the users, the interface must adapt to them.
