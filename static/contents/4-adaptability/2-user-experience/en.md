# User experience

## Definition

The criterion *user experience* refers to the means available to take into account the level of user experience.

## Rationale(s)

Experienced and inexperienced users have diŒerent information needs. It may be desirable to provide inexperienced users with promoted modes of transactions allowing simple step-by-step actions. For experienced users, computer-initiated dialogues may be boring and slow down their interactions; short-cuts may allow them to access system functions more rapidly. DiŒerent levels of interaction should take users’
experience into account.

However, most systems will have users with varying levels of experience. Users may become more expert with increased experience, or perhaps less expert after a long period of disuse. The interface should also be designed to accommodate the varying levels of users’
experience.

## Examples of guidelines

* Allow experienced users to by-pass a series of menu selections and make an equivalent command entry or keyboard short-cuts directly.
* Allow experienced users to key in a series of commands at one time, and inexperienced users only step by step keying.
* Dialogue types must be designed to match the needs of diŒerent users.
* Different dialogue types should be provided according to the experience of the various users groups (e.g., provide prompting as an optional guidance feature that can be selected by novice users but can be omitted by experienced users).
* When techniques adopted for user guidance may slow an experienced user, provide alternative paths or modes permitting a user to by-pass standard guidance procedures.
* Following the output of an error message, permit users to request a more detailed explanation of the error that is adapted to their level of knowledge.
