# Consistency

## Definition

The criterion consistency refers to the way interface design choices (codes, naming, formats, procedures, etc.) are maintained in similar contexts, and are diŒerent when applied to diŒerent contexts.

## Rationale(s)

Procedures, labels, commands, etc., will be better recalled, located, recognized and used if their format, location, and syntax are stable from one screen to the other, from one session to the next. In these conditions the computer system is more predictable, learning and generalization are facilitated, and the number of errors made is reduced. A lack of consistency can increase the search time considerably.  Lack of consistency is one important reason for users’
rejection.

## Examples of guidelines

* Window titles should always be located in the same
place.
* Use similar screen formats.
* Use similar procedures to access menu options.
* Consistent phrasing and punctuation should be
used in all prompts.
* Prompts for data or command entry should be
displayed in a standard location.
* Data entry fields should always be the same.
