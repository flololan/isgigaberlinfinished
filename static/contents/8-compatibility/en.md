# Compatibility

## Definition

The criterion compatibility refers to the match between users’ characteristics (memory, perceptions, customs, skills, age, expectations , etc.) and task characteristics on the one hand, and the organization of the output, input, and dialogue for a given application, on the other hand.  The criterion compatibility also concerns the coherence between environm ents and between applications.

## Rationale(s)

Inform ation transfer from one context to another is faster and more e cient when there is a limited volume of information to be recodeÁ d by the users.  
Efficiency is increased when: the procedures designed to accomplish a task are compatible with the users’ psychological characteristics; procedures and tasks are organized with respect to users’ expectations and practices; translations, interpretations, or references to the documentation are minimized.  Performances are better when information is presented in a directly usable form.

## Examples of guidelines

* When data entry involves transcription from source documents, ensure that form-® lling displays match those documents.
* Dialogues should reject data structures or organizations which are perceived by users as being natural.
* Calendar formats should follow users’ customs
(American Vs. European).
* Labels, prompts, and user guidance messages should be familiar to the users and task-oriente d.
* Units of measurement should be familiar to the user.
* Displays of textual data, messages, or instructions, should follow design conventions for printed text.
