# Legibility

## Definition

*Legibility* concerns the lexical character- istics of the information presented on the screen that may hamper or facilitate the reading of this information
(character brightness, contrast between the letter and the background, font size, interword spacing, line spacing, paragraph spacing, line length, etc.). By de® nition, the criterion legibility does not concern feedback or error messages.

## Rationale(s)

Performances are increased when the presentation of information on the screen takes into account the cognitive and perceptual characteristics of the users. A good legibility facilitates the reading of the information presented. For instance, dark letters on a light background are easier to read than the other way around; a text presented in mixed upper / lower case letters is read faster than a text presented in only upper- case letters.

## Example of guidelines
* Titles should be centred.
* Labels should be displayed in upper case letters.
* Cursors should be distinguished from other displayed items.
* When space for text display is limited, display a few long lines of text rather than many short lines of text.
* Display continuous text in wide columns, contain- ing at least 50 characters per line.
* Right justification should be employed if it can be achieved by variable spacing, maintaining constant proportional diŒerences in spacing between and within words, and consistent spacing between words in a line.
* In display of textual material, keep words intact, with minimal breaking by hyphenation between lines.
