# Immediate feedback

## Definition

*Immediate Feedback* concerns system responses to users’ actions. These actions may be simple keyed entries or more complex transactions such as stacked commands. In all cases computer responses must be provided, they should be fast, with appropriate and consistent timing for diŒerent types of transactions. In all cases, a fast response from the computer should be provided with information on the requested transaction and its result.

## Rationale(s)

Feedback quality and rapidity are two key factors in establishing user con® dence and satisfaction as well as for understandin g the dialogue. These factors allow the users to gain a better understanding of the system’ s functioning.
The absence of feedback or a delayed feedback can be disconcerting for the user. The users may suspect a system failure and may undertake actions that may be disruptive to the ongoing processes.

## Example of guidelines
* All users’ entries should be displayed except for secure entries. Even in this case, every keyed entry should produce a perceptible feedback (e.g., symbols such as stars).
* Following user interruption of data processing, display an advisory message informing the user that the system has returned to its previous status.
* When computer processing is lengthy, information concerning the state of the processing should be provided to the user.
