# Prompting

## Definition

As it is used here, Prompting has a broader definition than usual. Here it refers to the means available in order to lead the users to making specific actions whether it be data entry or other tasks. This criterion also refers to all the means that help users to know the alternatives when several actions are possible depending on the contexts. Prompting also concerns status information, that is information about the actual state or context of the system, as well as information concerning help facilities and their accessibility.

## Rationale(s)

Good prompting guides the users andsaves them, for instance, from leaning a series ofcommands. Good prompting also allows users to knowexactly the current mode, where they are in the dialogue,as well as the actions that result in that context. Thusgood prompting helps users to navigate in the application or the system and helps to reduce errors.
