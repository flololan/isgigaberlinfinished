# Grouping / Distinction by format

## Definition

The criterion *grouping / distinction by for-
mat* concerns more speci® cally graphical features (format, colour, etc.) that indicate whether or not items belong to a given class, or that indicate distinctions between diŒerent classes, or else distinctions between items of a given class.

## Rationale(s)

It will be easier for the user to know the relationship(s ) between items or classes of items if diŒerent formats or diŒerent codes illustrate their similarities or diŒerences. Such relationships will be easier to learn and to remember. A good grouping /
distinction by format leads to a better guidance.

## Example of guidelines
* Provide clear visual distinction of areas having diŒerent functions (command zone, message zone, etc.).
* Provide clear visual distinction of data ® elds and their labels.
