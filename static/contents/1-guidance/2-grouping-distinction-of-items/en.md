# Grouping / Distinction of items

## Definition

The criterion grouping / distinction of items concerns the visual organization of information items in relation to one another. This criterion takes into account the topology (location) and some graphical characteristics (format) in order to indicate the relationships between the various items displayed, to indicate whether or not they belong to a given class, or else to indicate diŒerences between classes. This criterion also concerns the organization of items within a class.
The criterion grouping / distinction of items is subdivided into two criteria: *grouping / distinction by location and grouping / distinction by format*.

## Rationale(s)

The users’ understandin g of a display screen depends, among other things, on the ordering, the positioning and the distinction of the objects (images, texts, commands, etc.) that are presented. Users will detect the diŒerent items or groups of items, and learn their relationship( s) more easily if, on the one hand, they are presented in an organized manner (e.g., alphabetic ordering, frequency of use, etc.), and if on the other hand the items or groups of items are presented in formats or coded in ways that indicate their similarities or diŒerences. Moreover, the learning and remembering of items or groups of items will be improved. The grouping / distinction of items leads to a better guidance.
