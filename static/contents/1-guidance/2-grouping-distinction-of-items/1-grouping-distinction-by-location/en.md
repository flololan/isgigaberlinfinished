# Grouping / Distinction by location

## Definition

The criterion grouping / distinction by loca-
tion concerns the relative positioning of items in order to indicate whether or not they belong to a given class, or else to indicate diŒerences between classes. This criterion also concerns the relative positioning of items within a class.

## Rationale(s)

The users’ understandin g of a display screen depends, among other things, on the ordering of the objects (images, texts, commands, etc.) that are presented. Users will detect the diŒerent items more easily if they are presented in an organized manner (e.g.,
alphabetic ordering, frequency of use, etc.). Moreover, the learning and remembering of items will be improved. The grouping / distinction by location leads to a better guidance.

## Examples of guidelines

* Organize items in hierarchical lists.
* Organize the options of a menu dialogue as a function of the objects to which they apply
* When several options are presented, their organization must be logical, i.e., the organization must represent a signi® cant or relevant functional organization (alphabetic order, logical ordering, frequency of use, etc.).
