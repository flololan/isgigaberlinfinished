# Error correction

## Definition

The criterion *error correction* refers to the means available to the users to correct their errors.

## Rationale(s)

Errors are less disturbing when they are easily, and immediately corrected.

## Examples of guidelines

* Users should be allowed to edit an extended command during its composition before taking an explicit action to ENTER the command.
* Following error detection, require the user to reenter only that portion of a data / command entry which is not correct.
* If a data entry transaction has been completed and errors detected, permit users to make corrections directly and immediately.
