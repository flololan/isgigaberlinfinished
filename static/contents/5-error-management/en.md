# Error management

## Definition

The criterion *error management* refers to the means available to prevent or reduce errors and to recover from them when they occur. Errors in this context include invalid data entry, invalid format for data entry, incorrect command syntax.

The criterion *error management* is subdivided into three criteria: *error protection*, *quality of error messages*, and *error correction*.

## Rationale(s)

System interruptions caused by users’
errors have negative consequences on the users’ activ- ities. In general, these kinds of interruption s increase the number of interactions and disturb the organization and the accomplishm ent of the task. By limiting the number of errors, the number of interruptions is also limited. The performance is thus better.
