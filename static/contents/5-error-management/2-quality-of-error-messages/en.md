# Quality of error messages

## Definition

The criterion *quality of error messages*
refers to the phrasing and the content of error messages, that is: their relevance, readability, and specificity about the nature of the errors (syntax, format, etc.) and the actions needed to correct them.

## Rationale(s)

The quality of error messages promotes users’ learning of systems by indicating to the users the reasons for their errors, their nature, and by teaching them ways to prevent or solve their errors.

## Examples of guidelines
* If the user selects an invalid function key, no system action should result except a message indicating the functions appropriate for that transaction step.
* For error messages, adopt task-oriente d wording.
* Make the error messages as speci® c as possible.
* Make error messages brief but informative.
* Adopt neutral wording for error messages; do not imply blame on the part of the user, or personalize the computer, or attempt to make a message humorous.
