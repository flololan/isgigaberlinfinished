# Explicit control

## Definition

The criterion *explicit control* concerns both the system processing of explicit user actions, and the control users have on the processing of their actions by the system.

The criterion *explicit control* is subdivided into two criteria: *explicit user action*, and *user control*.

## Rationale(s)

When the users explicitly deÂ® ne their inputs, and when these inputs are under their control, errors as well as ambiguities are limited. Moreover, the system will be better accepted by users if they have control over the dialogue.
