# Explicit user action

## Definition

The criterion explicit user action refers to the relationship between the computer processing and the actions of the users. This relationship must be explicit, i.e., the computer must process only those actions requested by the users and only when requested to do so.

## Rationale(s)

When computer processing results from explicit user actions, users learn and understand better the application functioning and fewer errors are observed.

## Examples of guidelines
* Always require a user to take an explicit ENTER action to initiate processing of entered data; do not initiate processing as a side eŒect (e.g., updating a ® le) of some other action (e.g., printing a ® le).
* If menu selection is accomplished by pointing, provide for dual activation, in which the ® rst action (positions a cursor) designates the selected option, followed by a separate second action that makes an explicit control entry.
* Users’ command entries should be completed with an ENTER action following editing facilities.
